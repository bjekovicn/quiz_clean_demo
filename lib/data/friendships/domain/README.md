# Domain Layer

The **Domain** layer is the heart of the application in CLEAN Architecture. It contains the business logic and the core functionalities of the application. This layer is independent of frameworks and external libraries, ensuring that it can be easily tested and maintained.

## Responsibilities

- **Entities**: Defines the core business objects of the application. These entities are simple Dart classes that represent concepts from the problem domain, such as `User`, `Product`, or `Order`.

- **Use Cases**: Encapsulates the specific business logic of the application. A use case represents a specific task or operation that the application can perform, such as logging in, fetching data, or processing payments. Use cases coordinate the flow of data between the **Domain** and **Data** layers.

- **Repositories**: Although repositories are implemented in the **Data** layer, the **Domain** layer defines repository interfaces. The Domain layer does not care about how data is fetched or stored; it only cares about the contract that the repository provides.

- **Use Cases**: Coordinates and orchestrates multiple use cases. The Use Case may combine data from several use cases to provide complex operations. It can be considered as a manager of use cases.

## Example

1. A **Use Case** defines the business logic, such as `GetUserDetailsUseCase`.
2. The use case interacts with the **Repository** to fetch the necessary data.
3. The result is then returned as a domain entity, such as `UserEntity`, which can be used across the application.

This separation allows for high flexibility and ensures that the business logic remains pure, testable, and independent of external technologies.

## Testing

The Domain layer is highly testable because it is not dependent on any external libraries, databases, or frameworks. Unit tests for the domain layer primarily focus on the business logic contained within use cases and entities.

By keeping business logic and domain objects in this layer, we ensure that the core operations of the app remain consistent and are not impacted by changes in other parts of the system.
